## 📖 Description

This project is a **Power BI Dashboard** designed to monitor and analyze a call center's performance.  
It visualizes key metrics like total calls, answered/rejected calls, agent performance, call resolution rates, and customer satisfaction ratings.  
The dashboard enables stakeholders to quickly identify operational strengths, spot problem areas, and make data-driven improvements.
